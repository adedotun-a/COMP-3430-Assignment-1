### Hypothesis

Threads were faster than processes as I expected in my hypothesis.

Reason: The reason is that a process has to copy a lot of data from the parent process and this spends a lot of resources and memory. Whereas, in the case of a thread very little copying of data happens. This makes threads faster than processes.

Conclusion: Keeping in view the data from table.txt we can clearly see that threads are faster than processes.
